The delivery range was listed as "August 21 - August 21." It was August 24 when my new FirefoxOS phone arrived. The phone is inexpensive, and it is underpowered compared to high-end iPhones and Android devices. But it has a major advantage over both iPhones and Android phones: It's not made by Apple or Google. 

I am a phone Luddite. This is my first smart phone. I find Apple's treatment of users and developers repellant, and  I don't want to carry an ad-lead-generator for Google around in my pocket. The alternative was nothing, since obviously a Windows phone is *completely out of the question*.  I suppose there's Blackberry, too. Didn't care.

These phone-resisting tendencies were reinforced by Stallman's comments on cell phones: 

>I don't have a cell phone. I won't carry a cell phone. It's Stalin's dream. Cell phones are tools of Big Brother. I'm not going to carry a tracking device that records where I go all the time, and I'm not going to carry a surveillance device that can be turned on to eavesdrop.

The quote is from [Network World, March 16, 2011](https://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/031611-stallman-reaction.html). At the time, Stallman was mocked as a crank (e.g., "Richard Stallman is kind of a lunatic. He's been tinfoil hat for many years now," from the same article). Recent revelations about the surveillance state have proven him right--it's not paranoia when it turns out that you have _understated_ the problem.

In any case, the Firefox phone has the advantage of being free software, _as far as I know_. That was enough for me. Firefox has been my browser of choice at home for years, even through the lean years; even when Chrome was pushing the boundaries of browser performance and capability. As Google slides more and more into the antithesis of its famous slogan, [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/) is once again in the position of being the defender of open standards and user freedom on the Web. That's worth supporting, even if it means an _underpowered phone_.

As [Linus Torvalds put it](http://mashable.com/2011/11/18/linus-torvalds-apple-lockdown/): 

> Technologies that lock things down tend to lose in the end.

Don't bet against the open Web.
